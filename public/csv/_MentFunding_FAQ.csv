Our journey started with the creation of mentfx.com, a trading education company that bridged the educational gap in the market. It was about more than just teaching; it was about empowering traders with real knowledge and tools to succeed.","But education was only part of the puzzle. We realized that many talented traders were being overlooked, unfairly evaluated, and taken advantage of by traditional 2-step funding models. That’s why Ment Funding was conceived. We wanted to provide a fair chance for those people to get funded and evaluated in a way that respects their skills and potential. We set ourselves on a mission to create one of the best prop trading firms.","Our model is built around simplicity and fairness. There are no hidden rules or complex steps. You trade what you want, how you want when you want. We offer a 1-step evaluation, and if you pass, you get funded with real money. Our rules are transparent, and our approach is straightforward. If the rule isn’t here, you are in the clear. There’s no risk – take your time when taking a challenge. Ment Funding is one of the first prop firms with no time limit.","We’re proudly providing trading capital for traders. But Ment Funding is more than a prop firm. It’s a community of passionate traders who want to redefine the industry standards. Get funded for trading starting today."
