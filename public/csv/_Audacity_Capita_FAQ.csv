"Empowering Professional Traders Since 2012","What is a Forex Proprietary Trading Firm?  Many traders have either heard of the forex proprietary trading firm or forex funding trader program but are confused with the two terms. They are like the same thing, and their purpose is to fund traders with the right amount of capital. This allows traders to have enough leverage to use for trading.  The proprietary firm typically uses its capital to create profits. It does this by hiring a prop trader who operates as the company’s contractor. When he makes profits, he will receive a certain percentage, and the prop company will take care of the rest depending on the agreement.  The proprietary firm can invest in various things in the market, including forex, stocks, bonds, commodities, and derivatives. This means that you can join a remote forex prop firm and choose any field depending on your experience and expertise.
