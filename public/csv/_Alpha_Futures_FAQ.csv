"Alpha Futures Evaluation & Qualified Trader Overview","Our Trading Evaluation is meant to help traders build their skills and habits as they hope to gain funding opportunities. Those that pass will become Alpha Futures Qualified Traders.     In order to take a Trading Evaluation, a monthly subscription is required. Evaluations may be reset at any time.     In order to pass, the trader must reach and maintain the profit target. The Profit Target is 6% on all account sizes.     There is only one rule on Evaluation Accounts, do not allow the Account Balance to hit or exceed the Maximum Loss Limit. Check this link here for more information on how the Maximum Loss Limit is calculated, but MLL is 4% on all Evaluation Accounts.     No Daily Loss Limit on Evaluation Accounts.     There is no maximum trading day or time limit on evaluations, but there is a 3 Trading Day minimum. We understand traders are eager to advance, but want to help them develop a consistent trading style.       All trades must be closed before 4:59 ET each day on both Evaluation and Qualified Accounts. Our system will automatically close them for you if you forget, but we recommend the trader closes themselves so they are aware of their P&L.     See the differences below between Evaluation and Qualified Trader Accounts below:    	  Evaluation  	  Qualified Trader     Minimum Trading Days  	  None  	  None     Profit Target  	  6%  	  None     Maximum Position Size  	  5 contracts/50k     (50 micros)    	  Scaling Plan to 5 contracts/50k     Maximum Loss Limit  	  4%  	  4%     Profit Split  	  None  	  Up to 90%     Resets  	  Unlimited, same as monthly fee  	  None     Daily Loss Guard  	  None  	  2%.     This is NOT a fail, it just locks your account for the day. We do not want to see our Qualified Traders lose their accounts in one day       Consistency Rule  	  50%     One trading day cannot amount to more than 50% of your overall profit before payout request. This is tracked on your dashboard.  	  40%     One trading day cannot amount to more than 40% of your overall profit before payout request. This is tracked on your dashboard.       Max Allocation  	  No limit  	  $450k     The main differences between Evaluation Accounts and Qualified Accounts will be Daily Loss Guard, Scaling Plan, Consistency Rule, and of course the ability to be paid out. We are looking to fund consistent, disciplined traders, not gamblers.   "
"Maximum Loss Limit (MLL)","The Maximum Loss Limit (MLL) is a trailing drawdown set at 4% of all account sizes here at Alpha Futures. This allows traders to pick whichever account size they please without having to change their style. Most of the industry operates with a 3% MLL on accounts larger than $50k.     How is it calculated?  The Maximum Loss Limit is calculated from your account balance high at the end of each trading day, not intraday equity high like many others out there. See the example below to understand.     You start with a $50k account, your starting MLL will be $48,000 ($2,000 or 4%).  If you make $500 on the first trading day in the $50K account, your account balance will be $50,500, which will make your Maximum Loss Limit $48,500 ($2,000 from the account balance high).     If you lose $500 the next day, your account balance would go back to $50,000, but your MLL will remain $48,500. This MLL will not go below $48,500 for the remainder of that account lifespan.     Once the Maximum Loss Limit reaches the initial starting balance, it won’t continue to trail. Meaning, if your EOD balance reaches $52,000 (+4%) your MLL will now be $50,000 and remain there for the account lifespan. ​  You can monitor your MLL on your dashboard. ​  What happens if I hit the Maximum Loss Limit?  If you break MLL, your account will be liquidated. This means any attempted orders after the breach will not execute.     Hitting the MLL on an Evaluation Account means that account will no longer be eligible for funding opportunities. You may try again by purchasing a Reset, or wait for your monthly rebill to return the account to the original starting balance to try again.     Hitting MLL on an Alpha Futures Qualified Account means the account has been breached and will be closed at the end of that trading day.   "
"Daily Loss Guard","The Daily Loss Limit also referred to as the Daily Loss Guard is a soft breach rule on Qualified Accounts only. If you hit the Daily Loss Guard, you do not lose your Qualified Account, but your account will be locked until the next trading day (6PM ET).     The Daily Loss Guard is 2% of account balance on all of our account sizes. If your open or closed (unrealized or realized) P&L at any point reaches -2% during the trading day, all open positions will be flattened, any pending orders will be canceled, and your account will be prevented from placing any new trades until the start of the next trading day.     This is in place because we don’t want to see our Qualified Traders losing their accounts in one day. We want to help them build consistency and discipline.     The Daily Loss Guard is based on each trading day’s P&L, which includes simulated commissions, fees, and both unrealized and realized trade P&L.     You can monitor your Daily Loss Guard in your dashboard. Traders can also make their Daily Loss Guard a smaller value, to really minimize risk, if they’d like on our platform, AlphaTicks.     Daily Loss Guard by Account Size:  50K Qualified Account = -$1,000  100K Qualified Account = -$2,000  150K Qualified Account = -$3,000"
"Payout Policy","Alpha Futures payout policy is extremely straight forward; follow the rules and you will be paid out. No additional hoops to jump through or hidden denials. Make sure to review our News Trading Policy. ​KYC MUST BE DONE AT LEAST 48 HOURS BEFORE FIRST PAYOUT REQUEST.  There are no limits or thresholds that must be met for withdrawals, but we reward consistency. Traders can earn up to a 90% profit split with a tiered system:     payouts 1 and 2: 70% profit split     payouts 3 and 4: 80% profit split     payouts 5+: 90%     The minimum payout request is $200.     Traders may request payouts from their dashboard every 14 days from the first trade placed on their Qualified Account as long as the 40% Consistency Rule is satisfied. Payouts will be processed in 48 hours or less.  Realize your withdrawals contribute towards your Maximum Loss Limit. For example, let’s say you have grown your $50k account to $55,000, your MLL is $50,000. If you want to, you may withdraw all $5,000 of your profit and receive $4,500 (90%).  However, your account balance will now be $50,000 which would breach MLL and effectively close your account.  We encourage traders to focus on longevity and pay themselves as they profit, rather than trying to catch one big day or week then close out the account."
"Consistency Rule","Evaluations  The Consistency Rule on Evaluations is 50%. This means that during your Evaluation, profits from one single trading day cannot be larger than 50% of your total profits made.     You will not pass your Evaluation until this rule is satisfied. Your largest day cannot be more than half of your total profit.   Qualified Accounts  There is a 40% Consistency Rule on Qualified Accounts however.     The 40% Consistency Rule means that during the simulated funded stage, profits from one single trading day cannot be greater than or equal to 40% of total profits made.     You will not be eligible for a payout if any of your trading day profits are greater than 40% of total profits made. This value will always be visible in your dashboard, and your payout button/feature will not be available until this rule is satisfied. ​ This rule resets in between each successful withdrawal request.     If you make more than 40% in a single day, your account will NOT be breached, but you will need to continue to trade and make more profit until the rule is satisfied.     The equation is as follows: biggest day/total profit = 40%"
