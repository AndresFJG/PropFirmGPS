"How Is The Max Daily Loss Calculated?  Daily loss limit is calculated based on 5% of the starting balance of each trading day.  This is the Virtual Account balance at the close of the daily candle on broker time.  For example, if the Virtual account balance is $100,000 and your equity is $101,000 (at the close of the daily candle), then your max daily risk for the following day will be 5% of the starting balance of the day $100,000 = $5000, and the Virtual profits on your P/L carried over from the previous trading day will be added to your daily loss limit. in this case, $5000 + $1000 = $6000.  The daily loss limit for this given day would still be $5000, but you’re allowed to lose $1000 more of the floating Virtual profits for a total of $6000.  Alternatively, if the Virtual account balance is $100,000 and your equity is $99,000 (at the close of the daily candle) then the max daily risk for the following day would be 5% of the starting balance of the day $100,000 = $5000, and the losing positions on your P/L results carried over from the previous trading day will be deducted to your daily loss limit, in this case, $5000 – $1000 = $4000.  The daily loss limit for this given day would still be $5000 initially, but since there’s a carried loss of -$1000 then will be deducted from the daily loss limit, and now a remainder of $4000 is left to lose before the Virtual account is flagged as Failed as per the daily loss limit.","","","","",""

"What Is the Lot Size Limit on Qualified Trader Accounts?  On Qualified Trader accounts the below max lot exposure applies to each account size.  Max lot exposure is the total combined allowed lots/position size allowed at any one time on the account.  For example, 100k max 40lots exposure, this means you can open 1×40 lot trade or 2×20 lots trades but you could not open 2×25 lot trades as the total exposure would equally 50lots and breach the max limit of 40.  $5k = Max 2.5 lots $10k = Max 5 lots $25k = Max 10 lots $50k = Max 20 lots $100k = Max 40 lots $200k = Max 80 lots  On Qualified Trader accounts, you can request for the limit to be increased, however, we require sufficient trading data on your Qualified trader account in order to grant an increase.","","","","",""
